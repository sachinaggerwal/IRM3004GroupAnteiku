<h2 style="color : #FFD95A;">Completed features</h2>
	-We have managed to successfully integrate a working shopping cart system. This allows you to add items to your shopping cart. There is also a functional counter that alerts you and lets you know how many items have been added. Clicking on the shopping cart also takes you to a page with all selected items ready to be bought.

	-We have implemented a linter. This allows us to keep our code to a certain nationally accepted standard. Code that does not pass this standard is not to be merged with the other code.

	-We have implemented a functioning carousel. This allows the items we have for sale to be cycled through in a clean and satisfying manner. This allows our users to see new items they may not have ever considered.

	-We have successfully integrated all the web pages that we have completed. The ‘Contact Us’ page and the ‘FAQ’ page are all accessible via the home page.
	-We have managed to implement a cohesive css that make all the pages look similar and related.

<h2 style="color : #C07F00;">Features not yet completed</h2>
	-We currently have webpages related to certain regions and their food that we haven’t yet completed but we plan to do so by next sprint.

	-Currently working on implementing automated tests for when we are trying to implement new code. This helps us recognize bugs and possible problems that need to be fixed.

<h2 style="color : #4C3D3D;">Canceled Features </h2>
	-Certain webpages for certain regions were canceled and merged with other regions due to multiple reasons. Some of these include, not having enough content to be a stand-alone and being very similar to other regions.
